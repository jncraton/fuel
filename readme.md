Assignment
----------

Create program which does the following, in this order

1. Request the mileage at the last fill-up from the user
2. Request the current mileage from the user
3. Display the miles travelled to the user
4. Request amount of gas added to the tank on this fill-up
5. Display the miles per gallon for this fill-up to the user

Here's an example run of a correct program:

    Enter mileage from last fill-up: 1000
    Enter current mileage: 1300
    Miles traveled: 
    300
    How many gallons did you just put in the tank? 8
    You gas mileage for this fill-up was: 
    37.5

The text of your program need not be identical to the above, but the calculated values should be correct.

Testing

I will be grading your program by passing a number of input to it and checking the output in an automated fashion. If you'd like to confirm that your program is working correctly, you may run these tests yourself.
